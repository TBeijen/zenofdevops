The [Zen of DevOps](/) captures a small set of principles
that value clarity, restraint, maintainability and reliability.

Based on the [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/), it aims to provide similar timeless and widely applicable guidance to the fields of DevOps, SRE, Platform Engineering and everything related.

## Means, not goals

> Don't let guidelines distract you from your goals!

One does not fail the Zen of DevOps when not being able to easily run multiple versions of an application.

A team might be performing perfectly fine, even though parts of the stack are rather ugly.

Once the guidelines themselves become goals, and become the center point of debates, one tends to lose focus on what one is trying to accomplish.

That being said: It's very worthwhile to unpack what the guidelines might accomplish in one's own specific context. How one could interpret the guidelines. Where they align or misalign and why that might be.
