title: About the Zen of DevOps
---

The [Zen of DevOps](/) captures a small set of principles
that value clarity, restraint, maintainability and reliability.

Based on the [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/), it aims to provide a similar timeless and widely applicable guidance, to the fields of DevOps, SRE, Platform Engineering and everything related.

## Means, not goals

> Don't let guidelines distract you from your goals!

One does not fail the Zen of DevOps when not being able to easily run multiple versions of an application.

A team might be performing perfectly fine, even though parts of the stack are rather ugly.

Once the guidelines themselves become goals, and become the centerpoint of debates, one tends to lose focus of what one is trying to accomplish.

That being said: It's very worthwile to unpack what the guidelines might accomplish in one's own context. What each one's interpretations is. Where they algin or misalign and why that might be.
