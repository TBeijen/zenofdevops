The [Zen of DevOps](/) captures a small set of principles
that value clarity, restraint, maintainability and reliability.

Based on the [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/), it aims to provide similar timeless and widely applicable guidance to the fields of DevOps, SRE, Platform Engineering and everything related.

## Means, not goals

> Don't let guidelines distract you from your goals!

You don't fail the Zen of DevOps when not being able to easily run multiple versions of an application.

A team might be performing perfectly fine, even though parts of the stack are rather ugly.

Once the guidelines themselves become goals, and become the center of debates, you tend to lose focus on what you're trying to accomplish.

That being said: It's worthwhile to unpack what the guidelines could accomplish in your own situation. The possible interpretations of the guidelines. Where they align or misalign and why that might be.

Explore!

Adapt!
