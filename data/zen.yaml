      Non-production environments are needed for safe experimentation and fast delivery.

      Any challenge identified and resolved in non-production is one less risk to worry about on production.

  - id: break-non-prod-only
    title: Be able to break non-production systems only
    python: false
    devops: true
    description: |
      Non-production environments must be representative enough to catch issues.

      Testing and observability need to be sufficient to catch issues.

      Isolation and guardrails should prevent accidentally breaking production.

      Promotion procedures need to be robust enough to avoid introducing issues on production.

  - id: more-than-one
    title: Design for more than one
    python: false
    devops: true
    description: |
      More than one instance allows horizontal scaling and provides resilience.

      More than one concurrent version allows rolling updates and canary releases.

      More than one deployment requires parametrizing the right things.

      More than one of anything requires automation.

      Design for more than one, to stay ahead of scaling and resilience needs.

  - id: more-than-once
    title: Design for more than once
    python: false
    devops: true
    description: |
      Hidden dependencies often only appear during disaster recovery or scaling.

      More than once allows upgrades to be repeatedly tested.

      Make rebuilding a habit, not a project. Weak spots surface when repetition is cheap.

      If you can't rebuild, you can't recover from disaster.

  - id: fast-over-slow
    title: Favor changes that make you faster over those that slow you down
    python: false
    devops: true
    description: |
      Friction compounds over time, while improvements pay recurring dividends.

      Prioritize work that reduces drag and simplifies future changes over quick fixes.

  - id: beautiful
    title: Beautiful is better than ugly
    python: true
    devops: true
    description: |
      Clean, readable code invites contribution and reduces cognitive load.

      Enforce consistent style and structure to make maintenance easier for everyone.

  - id: explicit
    title: Explicit is better than implicit
    python: true
    devops: true
    description: |
      Hidden logic, while solving a need, can be hard to reason about.

      Configuration values might be deliberately chosen, even though they are defaults.

      Implicit behavior hides important details and can lead to misunderstandings.

      Consciously choose what to expose and what to hide, guiding future changes.

  - id: simple-complex
    title: Simple is better than complex
    python: true
    devops: true
    description: |
      Simple designs are easier to understand, maintain, and scale.

      Accept required components, but keep their implementation as simple as possible.

      Prefer removing problems over adding solutions.

  - id: complex-complicated
    title: Complex is better than complicated
    python: true
    devops: true
    description: |
      Ignoring complexity can lead to complicated problems.

      Address essential complexity, while keeping accidental complexity to a minimum.

      Avoid masking essential complexity with artificial simplicity.

  - id: errors-silently
    title: Errors should never pass silently
    python: true
    devops: true
    description: |
      Make errors something that can be observed, diagnosed, and addressed.

      If something unexpected is encountered, don't ignore it.

      Blameless culture and post-mortems help turn errors into learning opportunities.

  - id: explicitly-silenced
    title: Unless explicitly silenced
    python: true
    devops: true
    description: |
      When not addressing an error, make the decision to defer it explicit.

      When accepting a certain risk, make that decision explicit.

  - id: ambiguity-guess
    title: In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess
    python: true
    devops: true
    description: |
      If guessing at the cause of a problem, try to reproduce and find the root cause.

      If guessing at the purpose of a component or piece of configuration, improve the design or documentation.

      If guessing what the effect of a change will be, seek ways to remove the guessing. Don't rely on luck.

      Become a fire-preventer instead of a fire-fighter.

  - id: one-obvious-way
    title: There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it
    python: true
    devops: true
    description: |
      Multiple approaches lead to fragmentation, confusion and cognitive load.

      Limit options through clear design, documentation, and standardized examples.

      Follow common patterns and conventions to make it easier for others to understand and contribute.

      If a design is difficult to explain, it is likely flawed.

      If the need for a design is difficult to explain, it might not be needed at all.

  - id: easy-good-idea
    title: If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea

      Even if a design is easy to explain, underlying assumptions might not be accurate, or change over time.
