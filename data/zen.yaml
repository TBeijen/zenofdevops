      Representative non-production environments allow testing and experimentation. This will speed up delivery and help identify challenges before they become problems.

      Is non-production representative enough of production, to identify all possible issues?
      
      Is test coverage and monitoring able to catch issues, before they hit production?

      After testing and fixing on non-production, is the procedure to promote changes to production robust enough?

    python: false

      More than one allows horizontal scaling.

      More than one concurrent version allows rolling updates and canary releases.
      
      More than one deployment requires parametrizing the right things.
      
      More than one of anything requires automation.
      
      Can you run two of these functions? Can you add a cluster without also needing to add a VPC?

      Unnoticably, circular dependencies will appear. 
      
      In the case of incidents, disaster recovery, or needing to scale, they will become very noticable.

      That thing that breaks because of an unpinned dependency? IaC that has become a monolith having too much in scope? Applications waiting for one another, that should have been rolled out in waves?

      Identify those points before they become pain points, by repeatedly building things from scratch.
