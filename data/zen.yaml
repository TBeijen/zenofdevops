    title: Be able to break non-production systems
    python: false
    devops: true
    description: |
      Representative non-production environments enable safe experimentation. Use them to speed up delivery and identify challenges before they impact users.
  - id: break-non-prod-only
    title: Be able to break non-production systems only
    python: false
    devops: true
    description: |
      Non-production must be representative enough to catch real issues. Ensure promotion procedures are robust enough to trust that success in staging guarantees success in production. 
  - id: more-than-one
    title: Design for more than one
    python: false
    devops: true
    description: |
      Designing for multiplicity enables scaling, rolling updates, and resilience. Automate everything and parametrize configuration to support running multiple instances simultaneously.
  - id: more-than-once
    title: Design for more than once
    python: false
    devops: true
    description: |
      Hidden dependencies often only appear during disaster recovery or scaling. Regularly build environments from scratch to expose and fix these fragility points.
  - id: fast-over-slow
    title: Favor changes that make you faster over those that slow you down
    python: false
    devops: true
    description: |
      Friction compounds over time, while improvements pay recurring dividends. Prioritize work that reduces drag and simplifies future changes over quick fixes.
  - id: beautiful
    title: Beautiful is better than ugly
    python: true
    devops: true
    description: |
      Clean, readable code invites contribution and reduces cognitive load. Enforce consistent style and structure to make maintenance easier for everyone.
  - id: explicit
    title: Explicit is better than implicit
    python: true
    devops: true
    description: |
      Implicit behavior leads to misunderstandings. Make important configuration and environment differences explicit, even if they match defaults.

  - id: simple-complex
    title: Simple is better than complex
    python: true
    devops: true
    description: |
      Simple designs are easier to understand, maintain, and scale. Avoid complex solutions that merely patch problems caused by previous complexity.

  - id: complex-complicated
    title: Complex is better than complicated
    python: true
    devops: true
    description: |
      Necessary complexity is better than artificial simplicity. Accept required components, but keep their implementation as simple as possible.
  - id: flat-nested
    title: Flat is better than nested
    python: true

    python: true

  - id: ambiguity-guess
    title: In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess
    python: true
    devops: true
    description: |
      Guessing relies on luck and leads to incidents. When in doubt, reproduce the issue, improve documentation, or redesign to eliminate ambiguity.

  - id: one-obvious-way
    title: There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it
    python: true
    devops: true
    description: |
      Multiple approaches lead to fragmentation and maintenance overhead. Limit options through clear design, documentation, and standardized examples.

  - id: may-not-obvious
    title: Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch
    python: true
    devops: false

  - id: hard-bad-idea
    title: If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea
    python: true
    devops: true
    description: |
      If a design is difficult to justify or explain, it is likely flawed. Ensure you can clearly articulate the problem, the solution, and why it is the best approach.

  - id: easy-good-idea
    title: If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea
    python: true
    devops: true
    description: |
      Even if a solution is easy to explain, question if the underlying problem should exist at all. Verify that the approach remains valid as requirements evolve.
  - id: namespaces
    title: Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
